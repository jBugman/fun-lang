## Fun
### Lighter, more functional language, compiled to Go

Idea is to provide cleaner (subjective) syntax and later some code-generation features around simple constructs to allow more concise code. Also, there is an ability to use raw inline Go code for more complex cases.

    package main

    import "io"

    func inc (val int) -> int = val + 1

    func print42 = print 42

    func main = do
        var line = "Hello World!"
        fmt.Fprintln io.Discard line


Tests

    gocov test ./fun ./print ./translate ./parse/... | gocov-html > coverage.html && open coverage.html
