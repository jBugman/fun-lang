# Fun

[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/jBugman/fun-lang/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jBugman/fun-lang)

Lisp-style language with static typing, compiled to Go.

Idea is to provide alternative syntax with more syntax sugar using code-generation to allow more concise code.
Also, there may be an ability to use raw inline Go code for more complex cases.

⚠️ Under active development. Expect changes to everything.

⚠️ Examples in `examples/` may not be up to date.

Transpiling is mostly literal, but there are some differences from Go:

* No arrays, only slices
* No `:=`, only `var` everywhere
* No named return values
* No `new`
* No `goto`
* No raw string literals (yet?)
* No declaring in if statement (yet?)
* Can't declare but can call a function with variadic parameters (yet?)
